# DSA with Striver – Beginner's Journey

Hello! 👋  

This repository is my **DSA journey as a beginner**, following the **Striver A2Z Sheet**.  
I started this repo to **help other beginners** who want to learn DSA step by step.  

Currently, I am focusing on **Arrays** (Easy level), and I am gradually adding more topics as I progress.  
The goal is to create a **simple and easy-to-understand collection of solutions**, so anyone who is starting DSA can follow along.

## **Why this repo?**

- Designed for **beginners** who are just starting with DSA  
- Each problem contains:
  - Brute Force approach  
  - Optimal approach  
  - Simple explanations and step-by-step comments  
  - Time & Space Complexity analysis  

- Anyone can **start learning from here**, no prior advanced knowledge needed  
- Beginners are welcome to **contribute** and improve this repo

## **How this repository is structured**

This repository is organised in a **simple and beginner-friendly way**.

For every topic, the structure will be like this:

- A main folder for the topic  
- Inside it, folders based on difficulty  
- Each folder will contain clean and simple `.cpp` files  

### Example (current state)

- Arrays  
  - Arrays Easy  
    - Programs related to easy-level array problems  

In the future, the same pattern will be followed for other topics like:

- Strings  
- Linked List  
- Stack & Queue  
- Trees  
- Graphs  

So whenever a new topic is added, you will already know  
**where to find things** and **how the folder is organised**.

Same pattern will be followed for every topic.
